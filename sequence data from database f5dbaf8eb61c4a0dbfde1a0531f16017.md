# Affinity bench v2

There are 136 set of data in database. **(chain ID provided)**

- **94** data are choose (two chains)

- Others are with multiple chains
    
    One of example is 1BVK_DE:F, with chain D and E are Fv Hulys11 and Chain F is HEW lysozyme. see [https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/1BVK](https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/1BVK).
    
    | Complex PDB | Functional class | Protein A | Protein B | Experimental dG | Experimental Kd
      (M) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 1BVK_DE:F | Antigen-Antibody | Fv Hulys11 | HEW lysozyme | 10.53 | 1.40E-0 |

data stored in 

1. ./affinitybench/affinitybench.seq.txt
2. ./affinitybench/affinitybench.dg.txt

# PDBbind-CN

There are 2850 complex with affinity binding (Kd, Ki or IC50)

2615 protein complex with affinity binding Kd. (remove uncertain value with â€˜>â€™ or â€˜<â€™, remove express with Ki, and IC50)

- The database does not provide temp, but mention measured in room temperature in literature. delta G is calculated using room temperature 298K

3ohm protein is replaced by 7sq2 in PDB database. [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/removed/3ohm](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/removed/3ohm)

4fqr is too large, do not have pdb file (only mmCIF) [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4FQR](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4FQR)

**The Chain ID are not provided** - hard to know which chain represents the protein name on excel

## select protein complex with only two chains

Using biopython select protein complex with only two chains. 

Only **635** protein complex are left.

data stored in 

1. ./pdbbind/pdbbind.seq.txt
2. ./pdbbind/pdbbind.dg.txt

## Using Uniprot labels

select data with two uniprot labels, **1557** protein complex are selected

The uniprot sequencing data from label are obtained from:

1. unprot.csv
2. extract from website
    
    ```python
    def seq_uniprot_lib (label):
        cID=label
    
        baseUrl="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"
        currentUrl=baseUrl+cID+".fasta"
        response = r.post(currentUrl)
        cData=''.join(response.text)
    
        Seq=StringIO(cData)
        pSeq=list(SeqIO.parse(Seq,'fasta'))
        result =str(pSeq[0].seq)
        return result
    
    seq_uniprot_lib('Q07011')
    ```
    

data stored in;

1. ./pdbbind/pdbbind_uniprot.seq.txt
2. ./pdbbind/pdbbind_uniprot.dg.txt

# SKEMPI v2

Original method is extract sequencing data from PDB model â†’ time consuming, file is large

## wild-type

**225** unique wild-type protein complex with two chains

method:

1. using corresponding uniprot label
2. using pdb files

data stored in :

1. ./skempi/wild.seq.txt
2. ./skempi/wild.dg.txt

## mutated type

**4165** unique mutated-type protein complex with two chains

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Then find the uniprot sequencing is not always corresponding to pdb sequencing

</aside>

![Untitled](sequence%20data%20from%20database%20f5dbaf8eb61c4a0dbfde1a0531f16017/Untitled%201.png)

Thus, have to use PDB file, Uniprot is not okay. 

new data stored in : (all sequencing from pdb bank)

1. ./skempi/wild2.seq.txt

mutation data stored in :

1. ./skempi/mut.seq.txt
2. ./skempi/mut.dg.txt

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Due to the version reason, adjust the position number of 1S1Q and 4PCA

</aside>

- 1S1Q works well
- two mutations in 4PCA is not corresponding
- all the mutations with 1KBH is wrong
    - sequence length is much smaller than mutation position on csv file
